# Deep Learning Tutorial By Bhupeshwar Pathania

The definition of Deep learning is that it is the branch of machine learning that is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.

# Why is Deep Learning Important?

The reasons why deep learning has become the industry standard:

1. Handling unstructured data: Models trained on structured data can easily learn from unstructured data, which reduces time and resources in standardizing data sets.
2. Handling large data: Due to the introduction of graphics processing units (GPUs), deep learning models can process large amounts of data with lightning speed.
3. High Accuracy: Deep learning models provide the most accurate results in computer visions, natural language processing (NLP), and audio processing.
4. Pattern Recognition: Most models require machine learning engineer intervention, but deep learning models can detect all kinds of patterns automatically.

# Popular Algorithms

## Convolutional Neural Networks

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a feed-forward neural network capable of processing a structured array of data. It is widely used for computer vision applications such as image classification.

## Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are different from feed-forward networks as the output of the layer is fed back into the input to predict the output of the layer. This helps it perform better with sequential data as it can store the information of previous samples to predict future samples

# Deep Learning Frameworks

## Tensorflow

Tensorflow (TF) is an open-source library used for creating deep learning applications. It includes all the necessary tools for you to experiment and develop commercial AI products. It supports both CPU, GPU, and TPU for training complex models. TF was originally developed by the Google AI team for internal use and is now available to the public.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is the most popular and easiest deep learning framework. It uses tensor instead of Numpy array to perform fast numerical computation powered by GPU. PyTorch is mainly used for deep learning and developing complex machine learning models.
